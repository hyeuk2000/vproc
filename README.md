# vproc
Virtual processor co-simulation element for Verilog and VHDL environment. 

Allows native C/C++ programs to co-simulate with verilog or VHDL simulations, with a basic memory read/write interface. This enables virtually limitless possibilities of control of a simulation from simple C/C++ programs, running as if on a virtual processor in the simulation.
