# Bus Functional Model Wrappers

This directory contains simple VProc VHDL and Verilog bus functional model wrappers for the Altera Avalon and AMBA AHB and AXI4 memory mapped interfaces. All models support the basic single word write (with write strobes) and read transactions, as well as burst operations. The AXI wrappers implement the minimal bus compliant signalling for an AXI4 manager with the xPROT signals fixed at 0.
